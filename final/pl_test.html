            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <h3>Unmasked</h3>
            <p><strong>Reason for Selection:</strong> The name "Unmasked" represents the profound journey of autistic
                individuals who have spent years hiding their true selves through masking behaviors. "Masking" is the
                exhausting practice of suppressing autistic traits to appear neurotypical. This site is about shedding
                that mask, embracing authentic neurodivergence, and finding community among those who understand. The
                name speaks directly to late-diagnosed adults who are finally discovering and accepting their true
                autistic identity.</p>
            <p><strong>Symbolic Meaning:</strong> Unmasking is not just about diagnosis - it's about liberation,
                self-acceptance, and living authentically without the constant performance of being "normal."</p>
            <p><strong>Domain Availability:</strong> unmasked-autism.org or unmasked.space</p>

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>Unmasked serves as a comprehensive resource and safe space specifically designed for autistic adults,
                with particular focus on those who received late diagnoses or are in the process of self-discovery. The
                site addresses the unique challenges faced by adults who have masked their entire lives and are now
                learning to live authentically.</p>

            <h3>Core Services:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Late Diagnosis Support:</strong> Resources for adults who discovered their autism later in
                    life, including coping with grief, identity reconstruction, and navigating "what could have been"
                </li>
                <li><strong>Understanding Masking:</strong> Deep exploration of masking behaviors, their impact on
                    mental health, burnout, and strategies for gradual unmasking</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Discovery Tools:</strong> Guidance for adults suspecting they might be autistic,
                    including trait recognition, self-assessment resources, and paths to formal diagnosis</li>
                <li><strong>Adult-Specific Challenges:</strong> Workplace accommodations, relationships, sensory
                    management in adult life, executive dysfunction, and maintaining independence</li>
                <li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Forums, support groups, and resources connecting
                    late-diagnosed adults with shared experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Neurodiversity Affirmation:</strong> Celebrating autistic identity as a natural variation of
                    human neurology, not a deficit requiring "fixing"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> This site rejects the medical model of autism as a disorder needing cure.
                Instead, it embraces the neurodiversity paradigm - autism is a different, valid way of experiencing the
                world. The site empowers adults to unmask safely and live authentically.</p>

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <div class="scenario">
                <h3>Scenario 1: Recently Diagnosed Adult</h3>
                <p class="question">"I'm 32 and just got diagnosed with autism. I've been masking my whole life without
                    knowing it. Now I'm exhausted, confused, and grieving the years I lost. Where do I even start?"</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> The "Late Diagnosis Journey" page will provide a
                    comprehensive guide specifically for this experience, including: understanding the grief process,
                    resources for processing decades of masking, strategies for gradual unmasking, connecting with
                    others who received late diagnoses, and rebuilding identity with this new understanding. The page
                    will validate the complex emotions and provide actionable steps forward.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scenario">
                <h3>Scenario 2: Self-Suspecting Adult</h3>
                <p class="question">"I'm 40 and starting to think I might be autistic. So many traits resonate with me,
                    but I've learned to hide them. How do I know if I'm really autistic or just anxious? Should I pursue
                    diagnosis?"</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> The "Self-Discovery" page will offer a nuanced exploration of
                    autistic traits in adults, common masking behaviors, differentiation from anxiety/depression, and
                    self-assessment tools. It will discuss both formal diagnosis paths and self-identification validity,
                    helping visitors understand their options without pressure to immediately seek medical validation.

            <div class="scenario">
                <h3>Scenario 3: Struggling with Masking and Burnout</h3>
                <p class="question">"I've been masking my autism at work for 15 years and I'm completely burned out. I
                    can't keep pretending anymore, but I'm terrified of being my authentic self. How do I unmask safely
                    without losing my job?"</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> The "Unmasking Guide" page will provide practical strategies
                    for gradual unmasking in various life contexts, workplace accommodation information, communicating
                    needs to employers, recognizing and recovering from autistic burnout, and building sustainable
                    routines that honor autistic needs rather than suppressing them.</p>

        <section class="plan-section">
            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p class="color-intro">The color palette centers around <strong>Abyssal Blue</strong>, a deep, rich blue
                that has become symbolic within the autistic community. Unlike the bright blue of mainstream autism
                awareness (often associated with organizations that don't represent autistic voices), Abyssal Blue
                represents depth, authenticity, and the neurodivergent experience itself.</p>

            <div class="color-palette">
                <div class="color-box featured">
                    <div class="color-sample abyssal-blue"></div>
                    <h4>Primary: Abyssal Blue #0A2463</h4>
                    <p><strong>The Color of Autism</strong></p>
                    <p>Used for: Main headers, navigation, primary buttons, section dividers, emphasis</p>
                    <p>Symbolism: This deep, oceanic blue represents the depth and complexity of the autistic
                        experience. It's calming yet powerful, mysterious yet authentic - reflecting the journey of
                        unmasking. This is the neurodivergent alternative to the problematic "light it up blue"
                        campaigns.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="color-box">
                    <div class="color-sample deep-teal"></div>
                    <h4>Secondary: Deep Teal #1B5E6E</h4>
                    <p><strong>Calm Waters</strong></p>
                    <p>Used for: Secondary headers, info boxes, hover states, supporting elements</p>
                    <p>Reason: Teal provides a soothing complement to Abyssal Blue while maintaining the calming,
                        introspective quality essential for a site addressing sensory needs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="color-box">
                    <div class="color-sample warm-amber"></div>
                    <h4>Accent: Warm Amber #D4A574</h4>
                    <p><strong>Golden Light</strong></p>
                    <p>Used for: Call-to-action buttons, highlights, important notices, positive reinforcement</p>
                    <p>Reason: Warm amber provides contrast without being overwhelming. It symbolizes the warmth of
                        acceptance and the golden moment of self-discovery when someone finally unmasks.</p>
                </div>

                    <div class="color-sample soft-grey"></div>

                    <p><strong>Gentle Shadows</strong></p>
                    <p>Used for: Body text, secondary content, subtle borders</p>
                    <p>Reason: A gentle grey that provides excellent readability without the harshness of pure black,
                        reducing visual stress.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="color-box">
                    <div class="color-sample cream"></div>
                    <h4>Background: Warm Cream #F7F4EF</h4>
                    <p><strong>Soft Foundation</strong></p>
                    <p>Used for: Page backgrounds, content cards, light sections</p>
                    <p>Reason: A warm off-white that reduces eye strain compared to stark white backgrounds, creating a
                        gentle, welcoming atmosphere that respects sensory sensitivities.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reason:</strong> Montserrat is a clean, modern sans-serif with excellent clarity. Its
                        geometric forms are easy to process for neurodivergent readers, and its various weights provide
                        clear visual hierarchy without being overwhelming.</p>
